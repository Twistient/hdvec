# Governance

This project is maintained by the HDVEC maintainers. We strive for:

- Technical correctness and clarity over premature generality
- Small, typed, and wellâ€‘tested APIs
- Respectful, constructive collaboration

## Roles

- Maintainers: review and merge pull requests, cut releases, and steer roadmap
- Contributors: propose changes via pull requests and issues

## Decision process

- Small changes are approved by a maintainer after review
- Larger design decisions are discussed in issues/PRs; maintainers seek consensus
- Semantic Versioning is used to signal breaking changes

## Releases

- Changelog entries accumulate under `Unreleased`
- When ready, maintainers cut a tagged release and move notes to a new version section
